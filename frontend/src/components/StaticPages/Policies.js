					At UniHomes, your privacy is very important to us and we are
					committed to doing everything we can to protect any personal data
					you give to us. <br />
					<br />
					This privacy notice describes how we collect and use personal
					information about you, in accordance with the General Data
					Protection Regulation (GDPR). <br />
					<br />
					This notice applies to: <br />
					<br />
					1. All Clients and Customers. <br />
					2. All Third Parties and Suppliers with whom we have dealings in
					the ordinary course of our business including those individuals
					with whom we send marketing information. <br />
					<br />
					Any reference to ‘you’ or ‘Data Subject’ shall mean any
					individual receiving this notice for whom we hold personal data.
					<br />
					<br />
					This Privacy Statement does not include information relating to
					the retention of data on limited companies as such data is not
					incorporated within the provisions of GDPR. <br />
					<br />
					We may update this notice at any time. In many circumstances we
					hold your data as a 'Data Controller'. This means that we are
					responsible for deciding how we hold and use personal information
					about you. We are required under data protection legislation to
					notify you of the information contained in this privacy notice.
					In some circumstances we may acquire or handle your data as a
					‘Data Processor’ which means we have been asked to handle your
					data by a third party other than yourself and do not directly
					store your data. <br />
					<br />
					It is important that you read this notice, together with any
					other privacy notice we may provide on specific occasions when we
					are collecting or processing personal information about you, so
					that you are aware of how and why we are using such information.

					THE INFORMATION WE HOLD ABOUT CLIENTS AND CUSTOMERS
				</h3>
				<p className="policies-content-text">
					Personal data, or personal information, means any information
					about an individual from which that person can be identified. It
					does not include data where the identity has been removed
					(anonymous data). <br />
					<br />
					There are “special categories” of more sensitive personal data
					which require a higher level of protection.
					<br />
					<br /> During the course of our business relationship with you,
					we will collect, store, and use personal information about you.
					This data may include your personal contact details such as your
					name, title, addresses, telephone numbers and email addresses.
					This is not an exhaustive list and we can provide you with full
					details of exactly what information we hold on request.
					<br />
					<br /> We will not ordinarily collect, store and use any data
					which is defined under GDPR as “special categories” of more
					sensitive personal information.
